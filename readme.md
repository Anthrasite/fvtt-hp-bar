### Temp HP
Displays a blue bar overlaying the current HP. If temp HP exceeds max HP, the bar will rescale to properly represent the proportion of temp to max.

### Max HP
Displays positive temp max HP as a light grey addition to the bar on the right side and negative max as a dark red bar with a vertical line.

### Nonlethal
Displays an outline over the HP bar that is light green if the current nonlethal damage is less than current HP (aka not staggered) and red if it exceeds current HP.

### Shadow of the Demon Lord
Shadow of the Demon Lord uses the concept of damage rather than hit points, meaning the default HP bar displays backwards. This system reverses the bar to display correctly, and adds a red outline around the bar if the character is injured.

### Themes
The default colors not working for you? Use the theme configurator to change the colors to your liking.
